# Intro to Ansible for IOS-XE - Mission Intro


This Mission will test the skills you developed during the Intro to Ansible for IOS-XE module. You will use an Ansible Module to create new Loopbacks and new VRFs on your router, and place the loopbacks to the new VRFs.


## Objective

The objective of this mission is to:

1. Modify the hosts file to define your Webex Teams token and Team space to post to
1. Modify the existing playbook to create 4 new Loopbacks 
1. Modify the existing playbook to create 4 new VRFs and place the new Loopbacks into the VRFs

## Prerequisites
To complete this Mission you need:

* A development environment with Ansible 2.5 and a compatible version of Python.  If you are at a DevNet Event using a provided workstation, you are ready to go.  If you are working from your own workstation, please review the ***"How to setup your own computer"*** link at the top of this page.  
* Lab infrastructure to target API calls and code.  These labs and code examples are written to leverage the [DevNet IOS XE Always On Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology).  This lab is available for anyone to use, with only access to the Internet as a requirement. To use a different device, ensure the device is running IOS XE 16.6 or higher.

You should also have an understanding of these foundational topics:
* The previous labs in the **"Intro to Ansible for IOS-XE"** Learning Lab Module.  
* Ability to read and understand Netconf configuration example. You can explore the **"Introduction to Model Driven Programmability"** module available on DevNet for an introduction to Netconf.
* Students are encouraged to have a basic understanding of Ansible. This module will cover some basics, but students requiring additional background are encouraged to review [Introduction to Ansible](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/sdx-ansible-intro). 

You are encouraged to review the prior labs and lessons for examples of ways to complete each of the mission tasks.
